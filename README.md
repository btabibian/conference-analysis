# Conference Analysis toolkit
---

This reposity **will soon** contain Jupyter notebooks and related codes associated with analysis of NIPS 2016 conference. Complete report is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09794). 

The toolkit is designed to be generic enough so that other conferences can use and adapt the framework for their own purposes. We hope it can be further extended and improved by other scientists for their specific needs.
